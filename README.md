# What is Trojan.JS.Youareanidiot?
This is the meaning of life. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSgk7ctw1HY for a demonstration. If link is broken(i.e. video/youtube account ded) message me for torrent of video.

# What this contains
This repository contains 2 folders. 

One is the "offline" version, where all(haha "all") of the required files and flash installer are supplied withing the "name_files" folder the html is referenced to. Of course, the meta embeds are broken, so add ur own site and links to the idiot.png embed for cool sharing embeds. I've put that part in a comment bracket so it should be pretty obvious to spot and edit.

The second is the "online" versions, which does not contain the required flash installers and idiot.png for reference from the html. Instead it links to the online flash macromedia installers which will probably be broken in a few months(2021 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa). idiot.png is included in a imgbb link which will probably die in a few years. OFC the home page meta is still in comments for obvious reasons. Should be also pretty obvious to edit.

Your antivirus will probs remove you.js as malware so turn off ur antivirus when extracting and keep it in a safe place where antivirus cant touch it.

# Overview
There was this internet page in like 2006 where if you went on there you would be greeted with the meaning of life(you are an idiot). This is a recreation of the webpage(preferrably for windows 10 I suppose lol).

Suggestion: Try in a VM. If not, make sure to have task manager at the ready or u will be met with very "cool" stuff :).

I would suggest you try this in a browser that will not block flash(i.e. Internet Explorer, or Firefox 2016- portable from portableapps.com. BTW link will probs be dead so PM me or sth for me to give you a torrent of a download of the portable forefox), and have ActiveX scripting enabled without prompt. 

# Browser setup
For Internet Explorer(preferrably 11): Go to settings, click on advanced, scroll down to security, and check the box that says, "allow active content to run in files on my computer". Then go to the pricacy tab and disable the pop-up blocker. Lastly, install flash plugin(haha RIP 2021 people).

For Firefox 2016- portable: Install flash plugin(lol 2021 go brrr).

# Get the effect and become the idiot
Right click on "Idiot!.html", select "open with", and click either on Firefox 2016- portable(not the actual name of the browser FYI lol), or Internet Explorer. Preferrably IE since the JavaScript was written for IE. The flash embed breaking the sad news to you that you are an idiot will appear. Now wait for a few seconds, and suddenly 4 bouncy windows with the same embed flash will appear. Keep waiting and more windows will pop up, until at last, all of your CPU and RAM will be consumed, and your computer will crash. OR you open task manager and close the browser. Either way tho your ears will die.

HOWEVER, if you try to exit out of the tab with the shortcuts ctrl+w, alt+f4, or press the delete button, a cute little alert will intercept that shortcut with the message of "You are an idiot"(no closing tabs 4 u haha), and then wallah 4 more bouncy tabs telling that u r an idiot will appear.

# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH HELP HOW DO I STOP BECOMING IDIOT?!
You can't. :-)

jkjkjk just use task manager to close the broswer(iexplorer.exe or firefox.exe or something like that). I suggest you open task manager before openning the Idiot!.html tho cause it will be hard to open task manager with the windows flying.

# It's 2021. How to get it to work?
Internet Explorer: uninstall the remove flash update. If u cant because you installed windows with media made after 2020 then sucks to be u ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Firefox 2016- portable: ur good. If u dont have it then message me for a torrent of the files or something but idk tbh.

# Disclaimer for unprofessionalism.
I have no idea what most things are on github(i am new :) ) so if i make something wrong/broken i dont care.
